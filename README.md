> This datapack should work fine from 1.21.2 to 1.21.4 but has only been tested in 1.21.4
FantasyRCE is a datapack for minecraft designed to use attributes to add races to the game.

There are currently 10 unique races:

Goblin,
Harpy,
Human,
Merson,
Orc,
Teifling

# Using Races
Races can be picked using `/trigger frce.menu`
\
Open the chat and click on the race you would like to preview.
\
Attributes can be hovered over to see more details.
## Generic Race Change
Once a race has been picked, to change your race you will have to craft a race change item.
\
For most races it is a single item called a "Race Changing Gem" with the exceptions being Harpys and Merson.

To craft a Race Changing Gem place 1 Diamond, 1 Netherite scrap, and 1 Ominous Bottle in a smithing table.

To use a Race Changing Gem simply hold right-click while holding the gem.
## Harpy Race Change
Once the harpy race has been selected, to change your race you will have to craft a Sacrificial Dagger.

To craft a Sacrificial Dagger place 1 Iron Sword, 1 Netherite scrap, and 1 Ominous Bottle in a smithing table.

To use a Sacrificial Dagger simply hold right-click while holding the dagger.
\
This proccess severs the players wings and deals damage.
### Note:
DO NOT LOSE YOUR WINGS
\
If you lose your wings and another person isn't willing to give you their severed wings you will not be able to become a harpy again.
### Becoming a Harpy again
Re-equip your severed harpy wings while not having another race selected to become a harpy again.
### Note:
Severed harpy wings can be used as an elytra when worn by other races.
\
This elytra has a max of 40 durability.

## Merson Race Change
Once the Merson race has been selected, to change your race you will have to craft a "Totally not a bucket of lava.".

To craft a "Totally not a bucket of lava." place 1 Lava Bucket, 1 Golden Apple, and 1 Ominous Bottle in a smithing table.

To use a "Totally not a bucket of lava." simply hold right-click while holding the bucket.

Keep in mind this process hurts a lot.
